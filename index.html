<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p>A multidisciplinary linguist & developer with a strong passion for anything linguistics, namely: syntax, theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics. Patrick grew up in Southwest Florida where he spent his spare time feeding his passion for self-learning. Building motorcycles and installing car stereo systems in high school turned into a job with the U.S. Army working on power generation equipment systems. While in the service, Patrick became intrigued by the power of language on a tour of duty in Iraq in 2011 where he spoke to an Iraqi Translator. Shortly after his contract ended, Patrick used his G.I. Bill to go to school and pursue his new-found passion. Language. 
<p>He received his B.A. In Linguistics from Stony Brook University in New York. While studying, his main interests were both theoretical and computational linguistics. As a part of his program, he studied one year of both French and Arabic; studying Arabic with the government STARTALK program receiving an ACETFL novice-mid proficiency certificate. <p>While at Stony Brook, he gained experience in <strong>developing</strong> while conducting research under the State University Of New York Research Foundation where he carried out a phonological experiment which included coding in Java, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Also, in the department's "Special Topics in Linguistics: Computational Linguistics" course, he programmed extensively in python and focused on natural language processing.
<p>Patrick got his first taste of <strong>linguistic</strong> experience while working for a year at Stony Brook's Multilingual and Multicultrual Communications Center (MIC) as a Linguist/Student assistant. While at the MIC, he worked with top global scholars to examine communicative adapatations by individuals as they transcend language and cultures. His time here was spent doing reaserch, conducting interviews and generating knowledge on the impact of global mobility and technologial innovation on language practices.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Now he writes computer programs to both analyze natural language and solve linguistic problems.</em></strong></p>

  <h5>
    <p>1.) When would you use '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them?</p>
  </h5>
    <p>Roughly, we can describe ‘=‘ as an <strong>assignment</strong>, ‘==‘ as an <strong>operator</strong> and ‘.equals()’ as a <strong>method</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<p>
	’=‘ is used to <strong>assign</strong> a value to a variable. In Java programming, you must first declare a variable before you assign a method to it. 	Assigning a value to a variable as also known as <em>initializing</em> the variable.

	The syntax for declaring a variable comes with it’s data type (int) followed by the variable name (x). 
	</p>
	<p>	…		</p>
	<p>	-> int x; 	</p>
	
	
	Assigning a value can be done on the same line as declaring a variable. This method can be used for saving space, and sometimes more readability, 	in a program by declaring and assigning a value in the beginning of the program.
	</p>
	<p>	…		</p>
	<p>	-> int x = 1	</p> 
	

</ul>

<ul>
	<p>	
	‘==‘ is an <strong>operator</strong> that compares the value of two objects to see if they refer to the same string instance. It used to compare whether two operands are equal or not. You can use this operator to compare primitive types (int, char, bool) or object references (String string1 = new String( “Value” ). If the value of both primitive instance’s are equal, the result of the boolean (true or false expression) would be “true”:
	</p>
	<p>	…		</p>
		int a = 8;
	<p>	int b = 9-1; 	</p>
	<p>	int c = 4;	</p>
		
	<p>	( a == b ) // True	</p>
	<p>	( a == c ) // False	</p>
	
</ul>


<ul>
	<p>
	‘.equals().’ is a <strong>method</strong> that compares the “value” inside a string instance. This method does not compare about object reference 	and only compares 	values of the instances. The only comparison made is that the array of characters are in the same order. This method also 		returns a boolean value as a result, returning “true” if the characters are in the same order and “false” if otherwise.
	</p>
	<p>	…					</p>
	<p>	String string1 =  “Patrick Gaston”;	</p>
	<p>	String string2 =  “Pat Gaston”;		</p>
	<p>	String string3 =  “Patrick Gaston”;	</p>

	<p>	string1.equals(string2); // False	</p>
	<p>	string1.equals(string3); // True	</p>
	
</ul>

    <p>2.) What does it mean to 'cast a double to an int'? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening?</p>
  </h5>
    <p><em>Answer here</em></p>
  <h5>
    <p>3.) What happens when you include 'import java.util.Scanner;' in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the 'java.' in 'java.util.Scanner;?</p>

  <h5>
    <p>4.) What is 'void' in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</p>
  </h5>
    <p><em>Answer here</em></p>
  <h5>
    <p>5.) When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a "parameter" and an "argument"? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</p>
