<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>A multidisciplinary linguist & developer with a strong passion for anything linguistics, namely: syntax, theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics. Patrick grew up in Southwest Florida where he spent his spare time feeding his passion for self-learning. Building motorcycles and installing car stereo systems in high school turned into a job with the U.S. Army working on power generation equipment systems. While in the service, Patrick became intrigued by the power of language on a tour of duty in Iraq in 2011 where he spoke to an Iraqi Translator. Shortly after his contract ended, Patrick used his G.I. Bill to go to school and pursue his new-found passion. Language. 
<p>He received his B.A. In Linguistics from Stony Brook University in New York. While studying, his main interests were both theoretical and computational linguistics. As a part of his program, he studied one year of both French and Arabic; studying Arabic with the government STARTALK program receiving an ACETFL novice-mid proficiency certificate. <p>While at Stony Brook, he gained experience in <strong>developing</strong> while conducting research under the State University Of New York Research Foundation where he carried out a phonological experiment which included coding in Java, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Also, in the department's "Special Topics in Linguistics: Computational Linguistics" course, he programmed extensively in python and focused on natural language processing.
<p>Patrick got his first taste of <strong>linguistic</strong> experience while working for a year at Stony Brook's Multilingual and Multicultrual Communications Center (MIC) as a Linguist/Student assistant. While at the MIC, he worked with top global scholars to examine communicative adapatations by individuals as they transcend language and cultures. His time here was spent doing reaserch, conducting interviews and generating knowledge on the impact of global mobility and technologial innovation on language practices.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Now he writes computer programs to both analyze natural language and solve linguistic problems.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Java!</h3>
<ul>
<!-- Question 1 -->
  <h5>
    <p>1.) When would you use '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'?</p>
  </h5>
    <p>Roughly, we can describe ‘=‘ as an <strong>assignment</strong>, ‘==‘ as an <strong>operator</strong> and ‘.equals()’ as a <strong>method</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<p>
	’=‘ is used to <strong>assign</strong> a value to a variable. In Java programming, you must first declare a variable before you assign a method to it. 	Assigning a value to a variable as also known as <em>initializing</em> the variable.

	The syntax for declaring a variable comes with it’s data type (int) followed by the variable name (x). 
	</p>
	<p>	…		</p>
	<p>	-> int x; 	</p>
	
	
	Assigning a value can be done on the same line as declaring a variable. This method can be used for saving space, and sometimes more readability, 	in a program by declaring and assigning a value in the beginning of the program.
	</p>
	<p>	…		</p>
	<p>	-> int x = 1	</p> 
	

</ul>

<ul>
	<p>	
	‘==‘ is an <strong>operator</strong> that compares the value of two objects to see if they refer to the same string instance. It used to compare whether two operands are equal or not. You can use this operator to compare primitive types (int, char, bool) or object references (String string1 = new String( “Value” ). If the value of both primitive instance’s are equal, the result of the boolean (true or false expression) would be “true”:
	</p>
	<p>	…		</p>
		int a = 8;
	<p>	int b = 9-1; 	</p>
	<p>	int c = 4;	</p>
		
	<p>	( a == b ) // True	</p>
	<p>	( a == c ) // False	</p>
	
</ul>


<ul>
	<p>
	‘.equals().’ is a <strong>method</strong> that compares the “value” inside a string instance. This method does not compare about object reference 	and only compares 	values of the instances. The only comparison made is that the array of characters are in the same order. This method also 		returns a boolean value as a result, returning “true” if the characters are in the same order and “false” if otherwise.
	</p>
	<p>	…					</p>
	<p>	String string1 =  “Patrick Gaston”;	</p>
	<p>	String string2 =  “Pat Gaston”;		</p>
	<p>	String string3 =  “Patrick Gaston”;	</p>

	<p>	string1.equals(string2); // False	</p>
	<p>	string1.equals(string3); // True	</p>
	
</ul>
  
 <!-- Question 2 -->
  <h5>
    <p>2.) What does it mean to 'cast a double to an int'?</p>
  </h5>
    	<p>
	We can think of ‘cast’ as being synonymous with ‘push’ in this instance. When we say we are ‘<em>casting</em> a double to an int’, essentially we are taking the value stored in <strong>double</strong> (a decimal value; i.e. 3.05) and storing it in an int (whole number; i.e. 3). In this process, the decimal is implicitly dropped and rounded <em>down</em> regardless of decimal value. Casting a double to an int can be done in multiple ways:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<p>	Casting in one step:		</p>

		<p>	…					</p>
		<p>	int x = (int)(11.26); // This will return:  x = 11		</p>


		<p>	casting in 2 steps:	</p>

		<p>	…				</p>
		<p>	double b = 3.4;		</p>
		<p>	double c = 3.9;		</p>

		<p>	int x = (int)(b); // This will return: x = 3		</p>
		<p>	int y = (int)(c); // This will ALSO return: x = 3	</p>
	</ul>
    
 <!-- Question 3 -->
  <h5>
    <p>3.) What happens when you include 'import java.util.Scanner;' in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the 'java.' in 'java.util.Scanner;?</p>
  </h5>
    <p>
	To get a better understand the function of <strong>import java.util.Scanner;</strong> we need to understand what a <em>package</em> is.
	A <em>package</em> is a bin for classes that we can call to use in our programs when we need to. This command is based on hierarchy (think of opening files in your computer and the file path being ‘Java/Util/Scanner’).

	<ul>
		<p> 
		<strong><em>import</em></strong> <br/>To call upon them, we need to first tell our program that we are seeking a package. This can be done with <strong>import</strong>
		</p>

		<p> 
		<strong><em>java</em></strong> <br/>After we tell our program we need to <em>import</em>, we then need to tell it where to look. <strong>java</strong> tells our program to look in the java file for… 
		</p>

		<p> 
		<strong><em>util</em></strong> <br/>Util is short for utility and contains a certain type of class we are looking for (utility)
		</p>

		<p> 
		<strong><em>Scanner</em></strong> <br/>finally, we tell the program what <em>class</em> we are looking for. Here, we call for the <strong>Scanner</strong> class. This class is predefined in the system for taking inputs from the user (in the form of keyboard strokes).
		</p>
	</ul>
    
<!-- Question 4 -->
  <h5>
    <p>4.) What is 'void' in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</p>
  </h5>
    	<p>
	Declaring a method can help us do many things in a program. For instance, we use methods already created in Java when we use predefined methods like <em>pause</em> and <em>getHeight</em> to save us from typing these methods all the time. The thing about methods is that they keep going until they hit a <em>return</em> value. Essentially, the method calculates (or does whatever you tell it to) until it hits return, then it returns whatever you specify outside of the method to facilitate your program.
	</p>

	<ul> 
		<p>
		so why <strong>void</strong>? The thing is, we don’t always want our method to return a value. Putting return void serves 2 purposes. The return tells our method to stop running and the <em>void</em> tells our method to return <em>no value</em> 
		</p>
	
		<p>	...				</p>
		<p>		<em>return void</em>;	</p>
  	</ul>
  	
<!-- Question 5 -->
  <h5>
    <p>5.) When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a "parameter" and an "argument"? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</p>
  </h5>
    <p>
When I first started programming, I would use “parameter” and “argument” interchangeably. It wasn’t after a while that I realized they were two separate entities and clearly distinguishable once you took a closer look. Let’s revisit the ‘.equals()’ method from earlier. 
</p>

<ul>
	<p>
	A <strong>parameter</strong> is a value that is set in the method definition when it is created.
	When <strong>.equals()</strong> was made, they created parameters in the form of a value within the parentheses. Roughly, the ‘()’’ in the method 	translates to “the value that is in this set of parentheses.” So, we can read it as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
	“The [method] named “.equals” will conduct the following algorithm (calculations, comparison, analysis, etc.) on the [value] within these parentheses.”
	</p>

	<p>
	An <strong>argument</strong> is what is passed <em>through</em> the method after it is defined. So if we use the ‘.equals()’ method: 
	</p>
	<p>…		</p> 
	<p>String string1 = “Patrick Gaston”;	</p> 	
	<p>String string2 = “Pat Gaston”;	</p>
	<p>in the following piece of code, “string2” is the argument that was <em>pass</em> through the method.</p>

	<p>	…				</p>	
	<p>	string1.equals(string2); // False		</p>
</ul>


</ul>
