<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p>A multidisciplinary linguist & developer with a strong passion for anything linguistics, namely: syntax, theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics. Patrick grew up in Southwest Florida where he spent his spare time feeding his passion for self-learning. Building motorcycles and installing car stereo systems in high school turned into a job with the U.S. Army working on power generation equipment systems. While in the service, Patrick became intrigued by the power of language on a tour of duty in Iraq in 2011 where he spoke to an Iraqi Translator. Shortly after his contract ended, Patrick used his G.I. Bill to go to school and pursue his new-found passion. Language. 
<p>He received his B.A. In Linguistics from Stony Brook University in New York. While studying, his main interests were both theoretical and computational linguistics. As a part of his program, he studied one year of both French and Arabic; studying Arabic with the government STARTALK program receiving an ACETFL novice-mid proficiency certificate. <p>While at Stony Brook, he gained experience in <strong>developing</strong> while conducting research under the State University Of New York Research Foundation where he carried out a phonological experiment which included coding in Java, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Also, in the department's "Special Topics in Linguistics: Computational Linguistics" course, he programmed extensively in python and focused on natural language processing.
<p>Patrick got his first taste of <strong>linguistic</strong> experience while working for a year at Stony Brook's Multilingual and Multicultrual Communications Center (MIC) as a Linguist/Student assistant. While at the MIC, he worked with top global scholars to examine communicative adapatations by individuals as they transcend language and cultures. His time here was spent doing reaserch, conducting interviews and generating knowledge on the impact of global mobility and technologial innovation on language practices.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Now he writes computer programs to both analyze natural language and solve linguistic problems.</em></strong></p>
